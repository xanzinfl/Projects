## Identifying buttons for YOUR mouse
The Autoclick script was made for the Pro X Superlight so if you want to find the button value for something like the G502 use this

1. Put the code from Button Finder.lua into logitech scripting
2. Press the button you want for auto clicking and it will output the number to console
  - Eg. `Mouse Button Pressed: 5`
3. Put the number shown into the "Button" Field on the auto click script
