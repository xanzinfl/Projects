# Random Projects

A collection of stuff I built for fun or convenience. Expect bugs, weird behavior, and unsigned `.exe` files.

> Yes, your antivirus might complain; no, they’re not viruses. I just don’t sign the executables because it’s a hassle.

#### Notes
- These aren't always production-ready. They’re projects I mess with when I’m bored.
- If something breaks, you're on your own — but feel free to open an issue or PR if you're feeling helpful.
